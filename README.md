The challenge was to design and develop a modern, responsive one-page website for a fictional task management app called TaskFlow. This app helps users organize their tasks efficiently and stay productive.

ðŸ’» What I Built:

Using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, I created a clean, mobile-friendly landing page that includes:

âœ… A hero section with the app name, a message, and a CTA button
âœ… A features section showcasing 3 unique tools of the app with icons and descriptions
âœ… A user reviews section with authentic-looking testimonials and avatars
âœ… A pricing section with three flexible plans: Free, Pro, and Team
âœ… A footer with social media icons and useful contact links
âœ¨ Bonus: Smooth scroll animations on section load for enhanced UX!

ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack Used:

React | JSX | Tailwind CSS | JavaScript | Framer Motion | Lucide React Icons | React Icons | Responsive Design | Layout Design | Component Composition

ðŸ“± Responsive Design:

Special attention was given to responsiveness, ensuring the layout adapts beautifully to both small and large screens.

ðŸ§  Skills Practiced:

Component composition, modern UI/UX layout design, scroll behavior, and animation handling in React â€” all aligned with real-world project workflows.
